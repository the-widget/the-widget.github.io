## Current Status

My name is Brennen Awana and I am currently a Full Stack Web Development student at Flatiron School in New York City. My decision to learn and work in the field of programming stems from my desire to have an occupation that I love and am excited about. 

I am living in the East Village in a tiny apartment with my beautiful wife, and I have to say, we are so happy with our cute 300 sq ft. apartment to call our home. We are expecting our family to be growing soon though, which brings me another incentive for my career change. I think if that I love my work, I'll be able to love and care for my family even more.

## Where I'm Coming From

I was born and raised in Hawai'i on the island of O'ahu on the Eastern shore in a small town called Kailua. I grew up with both my parents, a younger and older brother, and about 150+ relatives scattered around the island. My ancestry is rooted in native Hawai'i, Philipines, Hong Kong, Portugal and Europe. Having 5+ generations born and raised here is a recipe for diversity. 

As you may have suspected I did grow up surfing and yes, I did ditch out of high-school with my buddies on days when the waves were really good.

After high-school I applied for a very selective apprenticeship program at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. I was accepted for the position of Electronics Mechanic and immediately began on the job training and college courses. I worked on nuclear submarines, aircraft carriers and battleships and maintained a very diverse job scope. Sonar, radar, communications, optics, mechanics and weapon systems were some of our areas of expertise. 

It was a great learning experience and a boost in my work experience, but I wasn't able to say I loved my job. So, I decided to reset, step out of my comfort zone and move to NYC where I would hope to find myself where I am today.

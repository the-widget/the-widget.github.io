<p><strong><em>Grandma:</em></strong>  Okay, I can imagine that.</p>

<p><strong><em>Me:</em></strong>  Now, that’s a lot of information, and it all has to be organized in such a way that is easy to retrieve and display for us right?. That’s where API’s come in”</p>

<p><strong><em>Grandma:</em></strong>  Oh okay, so sort of like my box of recipe cards? I’ve got hundreds of recipes and there all cataloged by the type. Under my desserts tab I’ve got tabs for cakes, pies and muffins which then have specific types of cakes like red velvet and -</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This was by far the most challenging experience in programming so far. Learning about the different components that make up AngularJS was a fascinating process that made me very excited to use it to build a project, but when it came down to actually planning and building a project, I found myself a little spun. At this point in time the project is ready to be assessed because it fulfilled the minimum requirements, but is in no where near complete.</p>

<p>I remember waking up early in the morning, just as the sun tipped above the horizon and running upstairs to our box-shaped IBM computer with it’s companion, a bubble-curved glass monitor. After hearing the whir of the cooling fan and a few clicks and beeps, I was presented with a black screen with a blinking rectangle on the far left. With my little two-year-old fingers I would type out one key at a time. <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd:/ win</code> Magically, the program would load and I would soon have full control over the cursor, allowing me to play Solitaire, Minesweeper, SkiFree and Oregon Trail.</p>

<p>In a previous blog post I covered my first Rails App called Simple Sign Up, which was the Rails Assessment project for <a href="https://learn.co/">Learn.co</a>. In the next section, Rails &amp; Javascript, our assessment project was to take the same Rails App and modify it by implementing jQuery, for the front-end. We were also tasked to create an internal API in which all the jQuery calls would be made to. Sound a little confusing? Let’s break it down in smaller bites.</p>

<h4 id="rails-is-awesome">Rails is awesome.</h4>

<p>Rails is a popular MVC framework for programming in Ruby, and it’s just plain great. I haven’t even touched the tip of it’s potential as of yet, but as I learn more about it, I can feel my excitement building.</p>

<p>As part of the Learn.co curriculum, we are tasked to build a Content Management System, using “RESTful routes”, complex forms and authorization (including login from an outside source ie. Facebook, Google, etc.</p>

<p>This project was done as a final assessment in Learn.co’s Fullstack Web Development course for the Sinatra section. We were tasked to create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app of our choice. CRUD apps are sometimes referred to as Content Management Systems. I decided to make a community index for the world renouned book <em>“Bhagavad-Gita As It Is”</em>, by <em>His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</em>. I was deeply transformed by the study of this book, and felt inspired to implement it into my study of programming. I’ve found that by combining the things you already enjoy with new things you are learning, it makes the process so much more engaging.</p>

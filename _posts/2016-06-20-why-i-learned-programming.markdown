## Beginnings

I remember waking up early in the morning, just as the sun tipped above the horizon and running upstairs to our box-shaped IBM computer with it's companion, a bubble-curved glass monitor. After hearing the whir of the cooling fan and a few clicks and beeps, I was presented with a black screen with a blinking rectangle on the far left. With my little two-year-old fingers I would type out one key at a time. `cd:/ win` Magically, the program would load and I would soon have full control over the cursor, allowing me to play Solitaire, Minesweeper, SkiFree and Oregon Trail. 

## Gaming

As gaming developed, my interest in computer technology developed along with it. My childhood experiences with computers felt as natural as running around outside, climbing trees, discovering bugs and plants, and playing games with my friends. In fact the computer, magical as it was, seemed to take on the persona of a friend with a mental handicap, or a very primitive robot. It couldn't speak a word of English, nor could it understand me if I spoke to it and it had no idea who I was even though we spent years together in my house.

Despite this, one aspect of the computer opened up another realm of experiences for me. Gaming. Games transformed the dull computer into an amazing storyteller, an adventurous companion and a friend who was always available. This aspect of the computer caused me to question the workings of this machine, and eventually led me to my uncle Bobby's book, "C++ For Dummies". At 9 years old it's fair to say that my technical comprehension was pretty low and there was not much that I could grasp. Nonetheless I would read page after page and ask questions, gradually understanding the basics of computing, logic gates, and processors.

## Fast Forward

After a few highschool restaurant jobs, five years of working in electronics on nuclear submarines, and a year working as a field technician at various powerplants, my desire for meaningful and interesting work was like a burning fire. I remember reading a quote by someone that said, "If you love your work, you'll never work another day in your life." My pursuit for a new and fulfilling career had begun and I started thinking about what I loved to do as a kid. Memories of my fascination with computers came back to me, and I remembered the C++ book that I picked up a long time ago. Besides building websites using AngelFire in 2002, I had never pursued any career or hobby in programming. Nonetheless, I had a strong feeling that if I started learning now I could find myself in a diverse job marketplace and that I would fit in somewhere.

## Not Just Making A Living

The benefits of learning programming are many, but one of the main benefits that I like to consider is that it keeps your brain active in having to solve issues with creativity, community and research. Computer technology has found it's way into practically every realm of our lives. Even avodacodos and pears have a code that is tied to a computer program which tracks the import/export, cost, quantity and much more information. Our DNA code is now being understood more and being sequenced by super computers, allowing us to soon manipulate the strings of life. Of course making a respectable wage is desirable, as well as being able to provide nicely for one's family and children. But I feel that having interesting and exciting work can make be a happier father, a better husband and a more valuable contribution to society and the world.

## Why Web-dev?

As a fresh beginner, I need to be able to actively learn while I bring home the bread. Not being in a position to study at a university or pursue a college degree doesn't have to limit my abilities in this regard. Thanks to [Learn.co](http://learn.co/with/the-widget), I can become a "no-brainer" hire as a Junior Web Developer in under 8 months, no joke. In fact, I wouldn't feel confident to take up programming at all if it weren't for the success of the Flatiron School in the last 4 years. 

Computer programming is a huge field encompassing many specialties, technologies and sciences but the basic fundamentals of programming can be learned in the field of Web Development. I'll be graduating from the Learn.co curriculum in just under a month and I feel like I've taken the first step towards an adventurous career which many paths and options. The real celebration will happens once I land a job, but until then...

### Learn. Love. Code. <3
